## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### Critical Fix: Data Type Conversion ✅
- **Problem**: `type 'double' is not a subtype of type 'int'`
- **Cause**: DynamoDB Decimal values converted to double, Flutter expected int
- **Solution**: Updated BusinessAd model to convert `(json['likes'] ?? 0).toInt()`
- **Result**: No more type errors, posts display correctly

### Lambda Function Deployment ✅
- **Problem**: Old Lambda functions with incompatible parameters
- **Solution**: Created and deployed 4 enhanced Lambda functions
- **Result**: All API endpoints working with Flutter app

### Delete Functionality ✅  
- **Problem**: Delete operations not working
- **Solution**: Fixed parameter mismatch (id/hard vs action/adId)
- **Result**: Delete confirmed working through multiple tests
