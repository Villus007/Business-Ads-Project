# 🚨 PRIORITY AWS FIXES - Start Here!

## CURRENT STATUS: ✅ Your Flutter app works perfectly in development mode!

## 🎯 OPTION 1: Keep Using Development Mode (Recommended for now)
- Your app currently stores data locally using SharedPreferences
- Images are stored as base64 strings
- Everything works perfectly for testing and development
- **No AWS fixes needed yet!**

## 🎯 OPTION 2: Switch to Production Mode (When ready for AWS)

### CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED (In order of priority):

### 1. 🔴 URGENT: Fix Lambda Functions
Your Lambda functions have syntax errors that will prevent them from working:

**submitAd function - Replace with:**
```python
# Complete fixed code is in: aws_lambda_fixes/submitAd_fixed.py
# Copy and paste the entire file content into your Lambda function
```

**generatePresignedUrl function - Replace with:**
```python  
# Complete fixed code is in: aws_lambda_fixes/generatePresignedUrl_fixed.py
# Copy and paste the entire file content into your Lambda function
```

### 2. 🟡 IMPORTANT: Add Missing API Gateway Resources
You need these new endpoints:
- `GET /ads` - to fetch ads from DynamoDB
- `GET /presigned-url` - for image uploads

### 3. 🟢 OPTIONAL: Create getAds Lambda Function
- Create new Lambda function using: `aws_lambda_fixes/getAds_new.py`
- Connect it to the `GET /ads` endpoint

## 🧪 TESTING YOUR CURRENT SETUP

### Test Development Mode (Works Now):
1. Run your Flutter app
2. Use the debug button (bug icon) to see storage info
3. Use the image button to create test ads
4. Verify ads persist after app restart

### Test Production Mode (After AWS fixes):
1. Change `_isDevelopmentMode = false` in your Flutter code
2. Test ad submission and retrieval
3. Use the Python test script: `test_aws_endpoints.py`

## 🎉 RECOMMENDATION: 

**Start with Development Mode!** Your current setup is working perfectly. You can:
- Test all app functionality
- Verify image storage and persistence  
- Demo the complete user experience
- Fix AWS later when needed

**Switch to Production Mode** only when you want to deploy to real users or need shared data across devices.
