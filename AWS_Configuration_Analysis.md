# AWS Configuration Analysis & Fixes for Business Ad Platform

## Summary
Your AWS setup is mostly correct, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed for full functionality.

## Issues Found & Solutions

### 1. API Gateway Configuration ✅ MOSTLY CORRECT
**Current Setup:**
- URL: `https://uwmvuql9m7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`
- Resource: `/` with POST, GET, OPTIONS methods
- CORS enabled

**Issue:** Your Flutter app POSTs to `/ads` but your API Gateway only has `/` resource.

**Solution:** ✅ Fixed in Flutter code - changed to POST to `/` instead of `/ads`

### 2. Lambda Functions ❌ NEED FIXES

#### submitAd Lambda Function
**Issues:**
- Incomplete return statement
- Missing CORS headers
- No error handling

**Fix:** Use the corrected code in `aws_lambda_fixes/submitAd_fixed.py`

#### generatePresignedUrl Lambda Function  
**Issues:**
- Incomplete return statement
- Missing CORS headers
- No error handling

**Fix:** Use the corrected code in `aws_lambda_fixes/generatePresignedUrl_fixed.py`

### 3. Missing API Gateway Resources
You need to add these resources to your API Gateway:

1. **GET /ads** - to fetch all ads (use `getAds_new.py` Lambda)
2. **GET /presigned-url** - for getting presigned URLs (your existing Lambda with fixes)

### 4. DynamoDB Table ✅ CORRECT
- Table name: `BusinessAds`
- Partition key: `id (String)`
- Configuration is perfect for this use case

### 5. S3 Bucket ✅ CORRECT
- Bucket: `business-ad-images-1`
- Region: `us-east-1`
- Versioning enabled
- Proper encryption

### 6. CloudFront ✅ CORRECT
- Domain: `d11c102y3uxwr7.cloudfront.net`
- Properly configured for image delivery

## Required AWS Updates

### A. Update Lambda Functions
1. Replace your `submitAd` function code with `submitAd_fixed.py`
2. Replace your `generatePresignedUrl` function code with `generatePresignedUrl_fixed.py`
3. Create a new `getAds` function using `getAds_new.py`

### B. Update API Gateway
Add these resources to your API Gateway:

1. **Resource: `/ads`**
   - Method: GET
   - Integration: Lambda function `getAds`
   - CORS enabled

2. **Resource: `/presigned-url`**
   - Method: GET  
   - Integration: Lambda function `generatePresignedUrl`
   - CORS enabled

### C. Deploy API Gateway
After making changes, deploy your API Gateway to the `prod` stage.

## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Test with Development Mode (Current)
Your app is currently in development mode (`_isDevelopmentMode = true`), which:
- ✅ Stores data locally using SharedPreferences
- ✅ Converts images to base64 for local display
- ✅ Works without AWS dependencies

### 2. Switch to Production Mode
To use AWS services, change in your Flutter code:
```dart
static const bool _isDevelopmentMode = false; // Enable AWS integration
```

### 3. Test Image Upload Flow
1. User selects image
2. App gets presigned URL from `/presigned-url`
3. App uploads image directly to S3
4. App gets CloudFront URL for the image
5. App submits ad with CloudFront URL to `/`

### 4. Test Ad Retrieval
1. App fetches ads from `/ads`
2. Images display using CloudFront URLs

## Current Status: Development vs Production

### Development Mode (Current - Working ✅)
- Data stored in SharedPreferences
- Images stored as base64 strings
- No AWS dependencies
- Perfect for testing and development

### Production Mode (Requires AWS fixes)
- Data stored in DynamoDB
- Images stored in S3, served via CloudFront
- Requires fixed Lambda functions and API Gateway updates

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Flutter code is fixed and working in development mode
2. Update AWS Lambda functions with provided fixed code
3. Add missing API Gateway resources for `/ads` and `/presigned-url`
4. Deploy API Gateway changes
5. Test with `_isDevelopmentMode = false`

Your core infrastructure is solid - just need these updates for full production functionality!
